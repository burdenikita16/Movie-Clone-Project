** FETCH : it always return a promise
>>>> it include 
        .then()
        .catch()
        .finally()


** We take the the API_KEY from TMDB database and integrated it with our system and check into the browser part (References) to call that API's , to fetch the all data or not   


>> i have json data into my fetch part and i console it but where should i store it?
-----> ** I should be having a state which i keep all the movie data (json data) , thats why we use useState hook and now all json data we store into setMovies



**************************************
>> When we use useState and cosole it movies then that data will be rerended again and again & it takes a loop 

---> The component movies will be rerendered, when rerendered happend which means fetch part was called again, so again it will fetch 
---> we want that perticular fetch part from movie only gets one time, no matter it rerender or anything thats why we have useEffect to rescue
---> like this
  useEffect(() => {
      getMovies();
    }, [getMovies or empty array]);



**** We map the same component in same page inside the return part
